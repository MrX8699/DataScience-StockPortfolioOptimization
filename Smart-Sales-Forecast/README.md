# SuperKart-Sales-Forecast

## Project Overview
Accurate sales forecasting is critical for businesses to plan inventory, optimize operations, and make data-driven decisions. This project focuses on predicting the total sales revenue for a fictitional SuperKart’s outlets in the upcoming quarter, leveraging historical sales data, product characteristics, and store information. 

By developing a predictive model, SuperKart aims to improve sales planning across different cities and store types, ensuring efficient inventory management and better business strategy.

---

## Objective
- Predict total sales revenue per product for each store for the next quarter.
- Support strategic decision-making for inventory planning, store operations, and resource allocation.
- Reduce forecast risks and improve operational efficiency across all outlets.

## Dataset
The dataset contains sales records of SuperKart stores along with product and store attributes. Key features include:

**Product-level Attributes:**
- `Product_Id`: Unique identifier of each product
- `Product_Weight`: Weight of the product
- `Product_Sugar_Content`: Sugar content (low, regular, no sugar)
- `Product_Allocated_Area`: Ratio of product display area to total display area
- `Product_Type`: Category of product (meat, snacks, dairy, etc.)
- `Product_MRP`: Maximum retail price

**Store-level Attributes:**
- `Store_Id`: Unique identifier of each store
- `Store_Establishment_Year`: Year the store was established
- `Store_Size`: Store size (high, medium, low)
- `Store_Location_City_Type`: City tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
- `Store_Type`: Type of store (Departmental, Supermarket Type 1/2, Food Mart)

**Target Variable:**
- `Product_Store_Sales_Total`: Total revenue generated by each product at each store

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** – Analyze the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Create meaningful features such as sales trends, product ratios, and store-level metrics.
3. **Modeling** – Experiment with regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict sales.
4. **Evaluation** – Measure model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
5. **Prediction & Insights** – Generate sales forecasts for each store and product, and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Optional: Streamlit for interactive dashboard

---

## Outcome
- Predicted sales revenue for each product and store.
- Data-driven insights to optimize inventory, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance store-level sales strategy.
- Benchmarking against previous sales trends to identify growth opportunities.
