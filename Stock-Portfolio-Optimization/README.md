# DataScience-StockPortfolioOptimization
This project explores how network analysis can reveal hidden relationships between stocks and support smarter portfolio construction.
By mapping correlations among assets, the analysis identifies central (highly connected) and peripheral (diversified) stocks â€” and compares their performance to the S&P 500 benchmark.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To leverage graph theory and correlation networks to understand how stock interdependencies affect risk and return, and to evaluate whether central or peripheral portfolios yield superior long-term performance.

ðŸ§  Approach

Collected historical price data for a broad set of U.S. stocks

Computed correlation matrices and constructed a financial network

Classified stocks as central or peripheral using network centrality measures

Simulated portfolios based on these groups and benchmarked them against the S&P 500

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

Central portfolios â€” tightly connected stocks â€” tend to capture market trends and may outperform during growth periods.

Peripheral portfolios â€” less correlated assets â€” show greater resilience during volatility.

The S&P 500 serves as a strong baseline, but network-informed selection adds a valuable diversification perspective.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

Python â€¢ Pandas â€¢ NumPy â€¢ NetworkX â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ Yahoo Finance API

ðŸš€ Outcome

Demonstrates how network science can enhance portfolio diversification strategies and bridge data-driven modeling with financial intuition â€” a step toward more intelligent investment frameworks.
