# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio.
This repository showcases a curated selection of my analytical and machine learning projects focused on financial data, portfolio optimization, and business insights.
As a Senior Data Analyst with experience leading BI teams and building data-driven solutions on Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Power BI, my goal is to bridge technical expertise with strategic financial decision-making.

Each project reflects a practical use case from the intersection of finance, analytics, and data science — highlighting my approach to transforming complex data into actionable insights.
